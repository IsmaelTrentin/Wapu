# Wapu - MAL Characters API

### IMPORTANT!

Don't rely on this API since is in testing and will probably be offline most of the times. I will try to
fix it so that it will be up 24/7 by the end of summer (more likely before). 

### Premise
Since the shutdown of the original Discord [WaifuBot](https://top.gg/bot/472141928578940958?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=643fd8446c0cc1eba03c41afbc2898630011ce93-1596852477-0-AS3MfJIozFYg4Et7jmr3OZiXSLB6m8uGcH1byFLXjdxvLuw-EJmYmi_vESyi6QC0Zo0oswvScxri0pzHBizPjgnsgtYJo4ZGsQ2GRXx5mlgbBzDWBlgT1YcdAdYMblzDPpR_eDy9ZK-2Hq9eUYjW1_Rxn1XFsqQQ3N5SuesL5q1R62-fLwi5BPguBwcDYSKQyVphmpoM_4x1nJ40SGSKZL98NgagPRKwWPFzVE6QS20wgGdTFQ2ZCgNlRUbJrIno8HKotP960FTckk9WFYuYlpknKLqPoAnLSeuBdV1eDORY_4rgqj0pXXC3K8cN0CJdww 'The one and only') I wanted to try and recreate it by myself.
At first I searched for any [My Anime List](https://myanimelist.net 'MAL') APIs, but none of the small amount of existing one fit 
my requirements. Since i knew nothing about APIs I didn't want to create one by myself so I 
started working by saving characters data in JSON format. This idea quickly became 
inconvenient and slow so I finally decided to start learing about APIs and how to make them.

__READ HERE:__ I am new to APIs so this is probally going to be __BAD__, but it gets the job done.
I am also a student and I am no way near the level of a professional coder so the code 
will (most of the times) not be 100% efficient.

### Wapu
This API let's you fetch [My Anime List](https://myanimelist.net 'MAL') characters data (name, aliases, ...). The data fields added
by users (like gender, blood type, etc.) __are not included__ since they are not common through the characters. For example some have them and some not.


### Allowed HTTPs requests:
* GET : Get a character by its MAL id.

## Definitions

### Character

Defines the character data.

```typescript
interface Character{
    id: number,                  // The character MAL id.
    name: string,                // The character name.
    aliases: Array<string>,      // The character aliases.
    image: string,               // The character MAL image.
    animeography: Array<string>, // The character animeography.
    rarity: string,              // The character rarity.
    tags?: Array<string>         // The character optional tags.
}
```

* As of the **current version** the animeography contains only the amount of anime and not the names.

#### Rarity field

The rarity is calculated based on the user votes. These are the ranges:
